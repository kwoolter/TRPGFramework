exits North to the edge of a forest along a tunnel, South to the edge
of the moor along a narrow passage way and East to the edge of the
desert through a crack in the rock.
What next?inv
Aarlok is holding 1 items:
	a piece of lapis lazuli - a deep blue precious stone made of lapis lazuli : weight(1), value(10)
Total weight=1 (3% of max weight=33), total value=10.
What next?go south
You go South along a narrow passage way...
You are on the edge of a bleak moor land. The landscape is barren and
visibility is poor as a cold damp mist hangs in patches close to the
soggy ground.  There are exits North to a strange cave along a narrow
passage way and South to the moor along a boggy path.
